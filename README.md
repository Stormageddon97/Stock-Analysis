# Stock-Analysis
Studying VBA


## Overview of The Proejct
To give you an overview of this project, I used Excel VBA (Visual Basic Application) to analyze some tickertape for two seperate years.


### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to impove the time it would take our client Steve to analyze the ticker tapes of the stock market that his parents were interested in investing in. The use of excel VBA deemed to be an adequate program for Steve. It is a good use of this application, because you can easily change the data set to whatever it may be.

## Analysis and Challenge
The analysis of this challenge is (What i believe to be pretty straight-foward) I needed to see if whether or not Steve's parents were making the right choice, picking the correct coompany to invet in, that company being DQ. For 2017 DG would have been a good investment but for 2018, not so greaat.
 ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 I will be honest, I do not see a good application for VBA except to automate some good visuals. I had a very hard time trying to comprehend how Excel could be able to handle really large Data Sets. With that being said, I fully understand the concepts of it all but the application of it, rudimentary.
 
 ## Summary
 To summarize, Refactoring, data manipulation and VBA. Refactoring code can work really well. Would I refrator this code again? I hope I don't have to, I would love to improve my skills in VBA and I hope to, but I will need more time with it.
